# Project Title: Enhancing Customer Experience in Europe's Luxury Hotels through Text Analytics

## Introduction

In the dynamic and competitive world of hospitality, deciphering and acting upon customer feedback is crucial for differentiating luxury hotels in Europe. This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of over half a million customer reviews and ratings from nearly 1,500 high-end hotels across Europe, sourced from Booking.com. Employing advanced text analytics, our goal is to extract meaningful insights to enhance service personalization and drive continuous improvement in customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

The luxury hotel sector in Europe faces challenges in attracting and retaining discerning travelers in a competitive market. Conventional search and booking interfaces on travel websites do not fully cater to the nuanced needs of today's travelers. There's a growing demand for more intuitive, conversational interfaces that can match customer desires with the perfect hotel offering. Our project aims to bridge this gap by interpreting unstructured customer review data to identify what truly matters to guests, potentially revolutionizing hotel-customer interactions through NLP-driven conversations.

## Methodology

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis of 515,000 customer reviews to identify patterns, missing values, and data distribution. A stratified sample of 5,000 reviews was selected for efficiency without compromising insight diversity.
- **Pre-processing:** Advanced techniques including stop word removal, lemmatization, and POS tagging were used to prepare the data for NLP analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilization of the VADER tool from the NLTK library to categorize reviews into positive and negative sentiments.
- **Topic Modelling:** Application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and interactive visualization with PyLDAvis to uncover underlying themes in the reviews.
- **Feature Extraction:** Refinement of the TF-IDF method for highlighting sentiment differences, followed by K-means clustering to reveal patterns in customer feedback.
- **Predictive Modelling:** Employment of a Random Forest classifier to predict review sentiments, with an optimization focus to surpass an initial accuracy rate of 0.72.

## Business Implications

- **Hotels Recommendation System:** Utilization of customer preferences to offer personalized hotel suggestions.
- **Deepened Customer Insights:** Partnership with hotels to provide detailed service enhancement insights derived from customer feedback segmentation.
- **Informed Strategic Planning:** Leveraging insights from predictive modelling for proactive service and amenity design.

## Expansion Opportunities

- **Pipeline Automation:** Streamlining the collection and analysis of customer reviews.
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** Expanding data collection across various platforms for a comprehensive feedback understanding.
- **Customers' Needs Trend Analysis:** Comparative analyses of reviews over time to track trends in customer needs.

## Conclusion

This project marks a significant advancement in using text analytics to improve guest experiences in Europe's luxury hotel sector, setting a new standard for customer experience in hospitality and ensuring a competitive advantage through innovation.
